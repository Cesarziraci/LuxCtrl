## 🧠 Description 

**LuxCtrl** is a WiFi-enabled smart lighting controller designed to automate outdoor lights (facade and post lights). Built around the **ESP-WROOM-02**, it features:

- 2 isolated relay channels for controlling 230 VAC loads.
- Power domain separation (opto-isolated control + ferrite decoupling).
- Integrated **12 V and 3.3 V regulation** using IRM-10-12 and buck converter.
- Smart control via **UDP** (Raspberry Pi) and **MQTT** (mobile app).
- Visual feedback with onboard LEDs for power and relay states.

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ **Dual AC relay output** (for facade and post lights).
- ✅ **Optocouplers (SFH617A-1)** for galvanic isolation.
- ✅ **ESP-WROOM-02** soldered directly on PCB.
- ✅ **Onboard buck converter** for 3.3 V supply.
- ✅ **Power On + Relay status LEDs**.
- ✅ **PE pad** for safe chassis grounding.
- ✅ Designed for **home installations**, with wide copper zones (≥6 mm) for AC.
- ✅ Compatible with **JLCPCB fabrication** (ENIG finish recommended).

## 📦 Installation

1. Mount the PCB inside a protective enclosure (PE connected).
2. Connect AC input (L/N) and outputs to facade and post light circuits.
3. Provide AC power and connect the PCB to your WiFi.
4. Program the ESP via UART using external USB–Serial adapter.
5. Control via:
   - Local UDP from Raspberry Pi.
   - MQTT broker + mobile app interface.
